General Relativistic and Non-Relativistic Treatments}

\abstract{
The standing accretion shock instability (SASI) is a purely hydrodynamical
instability that is widely believed to have an effect on the re-energization
of the stalled shock in a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosion.
I will present results from a recently-submitted paper that investigates,
for the first time, the impact of general relativity (GR) on the SASI.
I will first give an overview of the SASI, then go on to discuss the physical
model we employ, our method of initializing the problem,
the code used for the simulations, and our analysis methods.
By comparing results from simulations using GR hydrodyanmics and GR gravity
to results from simulations using non-relativistic hydrodynamics and
Newtonian gravity, I will show that GR affects both the oscillation period and
the growth rate of the SASI to a non-negligible degree.
I will then briefly discuss implications of these results to CCSN simulations.
